Choose on a per-form basis which payment gateways you would like enabled for donors.

== Description ==

This plugin requires the Give plugin activated to function properly. When activated, it allows granular control over your emails per donation form.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.2 or greater
* PHP version 5.3 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.1 =
* New: Plugin now checks that Give is activated and the minimum version is met to activate this plugin. The plugin will deactivate if either conditions are not met.
* Tweak: Removed the "Default Gateway" option since that's already handled by Give core by default.

= 1.0 =
* Initial plugin release. Yippee!
